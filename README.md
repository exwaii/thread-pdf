# thread parser

This is something i put together to download the images of a thread into a pdf. In particular i wanted to make this [thread](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1586759472386449408 "facebook's little red book")  into a pdf, hence the double page per image thing. Read in two page view for optimal experience.

edit: broken after twitter api changes
